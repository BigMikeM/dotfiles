# TODO

## Planned implementation

1.  Set up citrix regardless of system. One option below:

```sh
cp /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/config/{All\_Regions,Trusted\_Region,Unknown\_Region,canonicalization,regions}.ini $HOME/.ICAClient/
```

I remember another implementation, however, that may be better. I need to find it again.
I remember it had soemthing to do with copying from the system certs rather than from the location in in the command above.

1.  Set up config symlinks in bootstrap

*   Doom nvim
*   Lunarvim
*   zshrc
*   zprofile
*   sheldon

## Possible implementation
