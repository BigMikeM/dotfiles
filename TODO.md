# TODO

## Completed ✅

- ✅ Fix continuing installation after rustup install - **COMPLETED**: Added proper cargo env sourcing and existence checks
- ✅ Finish nvim appimage installation with method from page (/opt/nvim/nvim) - **COMPLETED**: Now installs to /opt/nvim/ with symlink to /usr/local/bin
- ✅ Auto-source zshrc after installation - **COMPLETED**: Both install and bootstrap scripts now auto-reload shell config
- ❌ rnvimr toggle shortcut - **REMOVED**: Not implementing, Ranger works well as standalone tool
