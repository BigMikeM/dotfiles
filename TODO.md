# TODO

## Planned implementation

1. Set up NVM after it is installed

1. Install YAY with bootstrap

1. Skip setting up ZSH as shell if it is already set

1. Re-implement Doom Nvim configs (for the hell of it)

## Possible implementation

1. Integrate Pamac? (probably not, I still prefer yay)

1. Is it possible for me to download and install a font I like? What about also applying nerd font patch? Feasible, but is it worth it?

1. Is it possible to fetch and use the most recent version of the kanagawa theme for kitty (or other apps)? Maybe a curl + include?
