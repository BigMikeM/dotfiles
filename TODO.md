# TODO

## Planned implementation

1.  Add nvm install to bootstrap script.

1.  Set up config symlinks in dotbot install config


## Possible implementation

1.  Lunarvim installation and setup

1. Integrate Pamac? I think it's worth it for me.

1. Set up NVM (maybe only if it wasn't available before bootstrap?) and install node/npm in bootstrap
