# My custom config files

This is currently just a place for me to easily store, transfer, and share my terminal configs. I have a bad habit oh hopping linux distros so I decided to find a quicker setup solution.

Based on the work of [denysdovhan/dotfiles](https://github.com/denysdovhan/dotfiles) so please go check out that project if you're interested in anything here!
