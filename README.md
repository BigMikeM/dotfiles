# My custom config files

This is currently just a place for me to easily store, transfer, and share my linux configs. I have a bad habit of hopping linux distros, though I tend to stick to something based on Arch and sometimes Fedora or Debian. Hence, this repo will only attempt minimal support for those three.

Though I have made many changes and additions at this poing, this was initally based on the work of [denysdovhan/dotfiles](https://github.com/denysdovhan/dotfiles) so please go check out that project if you're interested in anything here!
