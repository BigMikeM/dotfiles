# Package definitions for different distributions and package managers
# Cross-platform consistency strategy for unified experience across all distros
#
# Package Priority Strategy (for maximum cross-platform consistency):
# 1. System packages (rpm, apt, pacman) - ONLY for:
#    - Core system tools (gcc, make, git, zsh)
#    - System libraries and development headers
#    - Shell utilities (shellcheck, shfmt)
#    - Terminal emulators (ghostty - native Wayland)
#
# 2. Cargo packages (Rust) - PRIMARY choice for CLI tools:
#    - Modern CLI replacements (fd, rg, bat, lsd, dust, etc.)
#    - Development tools (gitui, cargo-*, just, etc.)
#    - Cross-platform with consistent versions
#    - Fast and reliable
#
# 3. Flatpak packages - ALL GUI applications:
#    - Web browsers (Firefox, Chrome)
#    - Media apps (GIMP, VLC, Audacity)
#    - Communication (Discord, Slack)
#    - Ensures same versions across all distros
#    - Sandboxed and secure
#
# 4. Language-specific package managers:
#    - fnm → Node.js and npm packages
#    - uv → Python CLI tools (ruff, pytest, jupyter, etc.)
#
# 5. Snap packages - AVOID (prefer Flatpak for GUI apps)
#
# This strategy ensures:
# - Identical user experience across Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, and WSL
# - Latest versions of tools without distro-specific packaging delays
# - Minimal system package dependencies
# - Easy updates and maintenance

# Fedora/RHEL/CentOS packages (DNF/YUM)
# Note: Keep minimal - prefer Cargo/uv/Flatpak for cross-platform consistency
